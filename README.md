# VM-Setup-Virtual-Networking-Traffic-Capture

•	Built a simple “attack lab” using Remnux VM ,Windows VM and Kali Linux VM.

•	Drafted a report that describes the steps taken and, where necessary, the findings that were discovered.

•	Demonstrated connectivity between all three VMs, by using the “ping” command to attempt to ping the other three VMs.

•	Used the “tcpdump” command on a Linux VM and Wireshark tool to capture traffic. 

•	Used Netcat to establish communication channel between the VMs.

•	Used NetCat to provide a remote “/bin/bash” shell, and executed three commands over the connection and captured the traffic and included analysis of the command/response data in my report.
