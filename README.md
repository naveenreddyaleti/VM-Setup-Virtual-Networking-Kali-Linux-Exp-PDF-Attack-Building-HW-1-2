# VM-Setup-Virtual-Networking-Traffic-Capture. (Attack Lab)

•	Built a simple “attack lab” using Remnux VM ,Windows VM and Kali Linux VM.

•	Drafted a report that describes the steps taken and, where necessary, the findings that were discovered.

•	Demonstrated connectivity between all three VMs, by using the “ping” command to attempt to ping the other three VMs.

•	Used the “tcpdump” command on a Linux VM and Wireshark tool to capture traffic. 

•	Used Netcat to establish communication channel between the VMs.

•	Used NetCat to provide a remote “/bin/bash” shell, and executed three commands over the connection and captured the traffic and included analysis of the command/response data in my report. 


# Kali-Metasploit-Experiment-HW02 (Building PDF Attack)

•	Selected a PDF exploit (that targets the Adobe Acrobat Reader software) from Metasploit (Kali Linux has built in Metasploit in it) and built an attack with it.

•	Documented the Metasploit commands you used to create the attack and the versions of Acrobat Reader and Windows versions that it should target.

•	After creating the exploit PDF, used the pdf-parser.py utility to analyze the PDF structure and extracted the PDF object and/or stream data containing the payload and the characteristics it exhibits identifying it.

•	Documented the Encoding of the object (such as if compressed or ASCII85 encoded) and also the underlying data type (JPEG image data? JavaScript?) in the report that discusses the analysis of the exploit.
